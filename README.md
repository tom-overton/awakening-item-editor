# awakening-item-editor
An item editor for Fire Emblem Awakening that I made a long time ago. This was the second 3DS FE tool I created ever, so it's very rough around the edges. I'm releasing it now so that it isn't lost to the sands of time.

Either build with Visual Studio or download the release. Supply a GameData.bin.lz from Awakening's files and edit to your heart's content.
